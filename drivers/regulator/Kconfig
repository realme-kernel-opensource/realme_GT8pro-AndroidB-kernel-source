config REGULATOR_DEBUG_CONTROL
	tristate "Regulator debug control support"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This driver supports debugfs based control of regulators for testing
	  purposes.  It provides a mechanism to vote on the enable state,
	  voltage, mode, and load current of regulators that make use of its
	  interface.  It also extends the monitoring interface for regulators.

config REGULATOR_QTI_FIXED_VOLTAGE
	tristate "QTI fixed voltage regulator support"
	help
	  This driver provides support for fixed voltage regulators which are
	  controlled via a GPIO.  It also supports proxy consumer voting and
	  debug features utilized on Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. boards.  Use
	  this driver in place of the fixed voltage regulator driver if these
	  additional features are required.

config REGULATOR_PROXY_CONSUMER
	tristate "Boot time regulator proxy consumer support"
	help
	  This library provides support for boot time regulator proxy requests.
	  It can enforce a specified voltage range, set a minimum current,
	  and/or keep a regulator enabled.  It is needed in circumstances where
	  reducing one or more of these three quantities will cause hardware to
	  stop working if performed before the driver managing the hardware has
	  probed.

config REGULATOR_PROXY_CONSUMER_LEGACY
	bool "Legacy proxy consumer unvoting support"
	depends on REGULATOR_PROXY_CONSUMER
	help
	  By default, the proxy consumer library unvotes the proxy requests made
	  for a given device when the sync_state() callback of the device is
	  called after all of its consumers have probed.  When this legacy
	  unvoting feature is enabled, unvoting happens unconditionally at
	  late_initcall_sync() instead of per-device via sync_state()
	  callback calls.

config REGULATOR_QCOM_RPMH
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. RPMh regulator driver"
	depends on QCOM_RPMH || (QCOM_RPMH=n && COMPILE_TEST)
	depends on QCOM_COMMAND_DB || (QCOM_COMMAND_DB=n && COMPILE_TEST)
	help
	  This driver supports control of PMIC regulators via the RPMh hardware
	  block found on Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SoCs.  RPMh regulator
	  control allows for voting on regulator state between multiple
	  processors within the SoC.

config REGULATOR_QCOM_AMOLED
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. AMOLED support"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Supports the OLEDB/AB/IBB module in the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  PMICs. Exposes regulators to control the triple power supply
	  positive, negative and bias for the AMOLED display panel. It also
	  allows configurability for the various bias-voltage parameters.

config REGULATOR_RPMH
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Legacy RPMh regulator driver"
	depends on QCOM_RPMH
	help
	  This driver supports control of PMIC regulators via the RPMh hardware
	  block found on Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SoCs.  RPMh regulator
	  control allows for voting on regulator state between multiple
	  processors within the SoC.

config REGULATOR_STUB
	tristate "Stub Regulator"
	help
	  This driver adds stub regulator support. It allows for consumers to
	  request their regulator devices and to use all of the standard
	  regulator functions. It is useful for bringing up new platforms when
	  the real hardware based regulator implementation is not yet available.
	  Consumers can use stub regulator device with proper constraint
	  checking while the real regulator driver is being developed.

config REGULATOR_QTI_OCP_NOTIFIER
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Regulator OCP Notifier Driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for logging and notifying consumers about
	  regulator over-current (OCP) events on certain Qualcomm Technologies,
	  Inc. PMIC devices.  This is useful for debugging as well as for
	  providing a more graceful recovery mechanism than resetting the entire
	  system.
