config UFS_DBG
	bool "Universal Flash Storage Debug Mode"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	help
	This selects the debug mode for ufs vendor driver.
	  Enables tracing for QTI ufs driver.
	  This also enables ftrace for ufs core and SCSI.
	  Enabling this would have an adverse performance impact on disk IO.

	  If unsure, say N.

	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && ARCH_QCOM

	select QCOM_INLINE_CRYPTO_ENGINE if SCSI_UFS_CRYPTO
	help
	  This selects the QCOM specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.
	  UFS host on QCOM needs some vendor specific configuration before
	  accessing the hardware which includes PHY configuration and vendor
	  specific registers.

	  Select this if you have UFS controller on QCOM chipset.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_CRYPTO_QTI
	tristate "UFS Crypto Engine Support for QCOM Hardware Wrapped Keys"
	depends on SCSI_UFS_CRYPTO && SCSI_UFS_QCOM && QCOM_INLINE_CRYPTO_ENGINE
	help
	  Enable Crypto Engine Support in UFS for QCOM chipsets supporting
	  wrapped keys. This is explicitly required until wrapped keys support
	  for QCOM chipsets is part of Linux upstream.

	  Select this to enable QCOM Hardware Wrapped Key support for the
	  ICE hardware.
