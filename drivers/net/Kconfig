	  Enable this option to include the VirtIO-based network driver.
	  This driver is essential for supporting VirtIO network devices,
	  commonly used in virtualization environments. It works with
	  QEMU-based virtual machine managers (e.g., KVM or Xen).
	  Say Y or M.

	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
	  any other computer at all.

	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
	  you want to use under Linux. If you are going to run SLIP or PPP over
	  telephone line or null modem cable you need say Y here. Connecting
	  two machines with parallel ports using PLIP needs this, as well as
	  AX.25/KISS for sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links.

	  See also "The Linux Network Administrator's Guide" by Olaf Kirch and
	  Terry Dawson. Available at <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

	  If unsure, say Y.
