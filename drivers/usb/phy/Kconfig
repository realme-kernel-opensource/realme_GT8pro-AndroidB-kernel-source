config NOP_USB_XCEIV
	tristate "NOP USB Transceiver Driver"
	depends on USB_GADGET || !USB_GADGET # if USB_GADGET=m, NOP can't be built-in
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  This driver is to be used by all the usb transceiver which are either
	  built-in with usb ip or which are autonomous and doesn't require any
	  phy programming such as ISP1x04 etc.

config USB_QCOM_EMU_PHY
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. emulation USB PHY driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB transceiver used on
	  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. emulation platforms. It simply performs
	  PHY initialization given a basic register write sequence.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called phy-qcom-emu.

config USB_MSM_SSPHY_QMP
	tristate "MSM SSUSB QMP PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the SuperSpeed USB transceiver on MSM chips.
	  This driver supports the PHY which uses the QSCRATCH-based register
	  set for its control sequences, normally paired with newer DWC3-based
	  SuperSpeed controllers.

config MSM_HSUSB_PHY
	tristate "MSM HSUSB PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the HSUSB PHY on MSM chips. This driver supports
	  the high-speed PHY which is usually paired with either the ChipIdea or
	  Synopsys DWC3 USB IPs on MSM SOCs. This driver expects to configure the
	  PHY with a dedicated register I/O memory region.

config USB_MSM_EUSB2_PHY
	tristate "MSM EUSB2 PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB EUSB2 PHY on MSM chips. This driver
	  supports reset and initialization sequence, and also perform required
	  set of operations with used repeater for USB HS/FS/LS functionality.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config USB_M31_MSM_EUSB2_PHY
	tristate "M31 MSM EUSB2 PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the M31 EUSB2 PHY on MSM chips. This driver
	  supports reset and initialization sequence, and also perform required
	  set of operations with used repeater for USB HS/FS/LS functionality.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
