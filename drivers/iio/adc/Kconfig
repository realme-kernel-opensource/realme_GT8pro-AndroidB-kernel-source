	help
	  This is for the PMIC Round Robin ADC driver.

	  This driver exposes the battery ID resistor, battery thermal, PMIC die
	  temperature, charger USB in and DC in voltage and current.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called qcom-qpmi-rradc.

	select QCOM_VADC_COMMON
	help
	  This is the IIO Voltage PMIC5 Gen3 ADC driver for Qualcomm Technologies Inc.

	  The driver supports multiple channels read. The ADC is a 16-bit
	  sigma-delta ADC. The hardware supports calibrated results for
	  conversion requests and clients include reading voltage phone
	  power, on board system thermistors connected to the PMIC ADC,
	  PMIC die temperature, charger temperature, battery current, USB voltage
	  input, voltage signals connected to supported PMIC GPIO inputs. The
	  hardware supports internal pull-up for thermistors and can choose between
	  a 100k, 30k and 400k pull up using the ADC channels.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called qcom-spmi-adc5-gen3.

config QTI_GLINK_ADC
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies Inc. PMIC Glink ADC"
	depends on QTI_PMIC_GLINK
	help
	  This is the IIO PMIC Glink ADC driver for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
	  PMICs.  It supports reading multiple ADC channels using the Glink
	  interface to communicate with charger firmware.  Channel value
	  conversion is performed in firmware.  Both converted and raw values
	  can be read.
