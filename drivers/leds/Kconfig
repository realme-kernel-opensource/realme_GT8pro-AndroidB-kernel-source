	  This driver supports flash LED peripheral that is present on
	  some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMICs (e.g. PM8350C).  It can
	  configure the flash LED target current for several independent
	  channels. It also supports various over current and over
	  temperature mitigation features.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called leds-qti-flash.
