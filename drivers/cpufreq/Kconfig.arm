	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Qualcomm Kryo SoC based boards.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  Support for the CPUFreq HW driver.
	  Some QCOM chipsets have a HW engine to offload the steps
	  necessary for changing the frequency of the CPUs. Firmware loaded
	  in this engine exposes a programming interface to the OS.
	  The driver implements the cpufreq interface for this HW engine.
	  Say Y if you want to support CPUFreq HW.

	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Support for the CPUFreq thermal pressure notification driver. Some
	  QCOM chipsets have a separate firmware entity that monitors the
	  current thermal limits of the CPUs. The firmware communicates the
	  thermal limits to HLOS through dedicated mailboxes. This driver
	  registers for those mailbox notification and informs the scheduler.
	  Say Y if you want to support these mailbox thermal notifications.
