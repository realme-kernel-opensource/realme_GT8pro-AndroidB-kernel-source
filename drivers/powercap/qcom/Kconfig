	  This enables Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. power telemetry framework.
	  It provides a framework support to register for different power
	  capable device channels. Based on devicetree power-zones hierarchy,
	  it binds different channels to power-zone node (aka qptm). Each
	  qptm node registers with powercap framework as powercap zones.
