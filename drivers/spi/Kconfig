	  This driver supports GENI serial engine based Q2SPI controller in
	  master mode on the Qualcomm Technologies Inc.'s SoCs. If you say
	  yes to this option, support will be included for the built-in Q2SPI
	  interface on the Qualcomm Technologies Inc.'s SoCs.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called q2spi-geni.
