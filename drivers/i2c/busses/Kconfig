	  This driver supports GENI serial engine based I2C controller in
	  master mode on the Qualcomm Technologies Inc.'s SoCs. If you say
	  yes to this option, support will be included for the built-in I2C
	  interface on the Qualcomm Technologies Inc.'s SoCs.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-msm-geni.
