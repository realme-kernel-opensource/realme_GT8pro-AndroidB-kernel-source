          MSM boards support booting to special download modes after a restart.
          These modes could be a normal restart, restarting into a
          ramdump collection mode (CrashDump), or restarting into "emergency
          download mode".

          A device with "download mode" enabled will upon an unexpected
          warm-restart enter a special debug mode that allows the user to
          "download" memory content over USB for offline postmortem analysis.
          The feature can be enabled/disabled on the kernel command line.

          Say Y here to enable "download mode" by default.
