	  Enable support for the QCOM GPI DMA controller. This controller
	  provides DMA capabilities for a variety of peripheral buses such
	  as I2C, UART, and SPI. By using GPI dmaengine driver, bus drivers
	  can use a standardize interface that is protocol independent to
	  transfer data between DDR and peripheral.

	  Enable detailed logging for QCOM GPI driver. Extra logging will be
	  helpful when debugging critical issues. By using GPI dmaengine driver,
	  bus drivers can use a standardize interface that is protocol independent
	  to transfer data between DDR and peripheral.
